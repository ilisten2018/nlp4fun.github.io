### Task Description
Language games draw their challenge and excitement from the richness and ambiguity of natural language, and therefore have attracted the attention of researchers in the fields of Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing.
For instance, IBM WatsonTM is a system which successfully challenged human champions of Jeopardy!TM, a game in which contestants are presented with clues in the form of answers, and must phrase their responses in the form of a question [1][1] . Other researchers exploited question answering techniques to build an artificial player for _“Who Wants to be a Millionaire?”_ [2]. Another popular language game is solving crossword puzzles. The first experience reported in the literature is Proverb [3], that exploits large libraries of clues and solutions to past crossword puzzles. WebCrow is the first solver for Italian crosswords [4].

The proposed task consists in designing a solver for **“The Guillotine” (La Ghigliottina, in Italian)** game. It is inspired by the final game of an Italian TV show called “L’eredità”. The game, broadcast by Italian National TV, involves a single player, who is given a set of five words - the clues - each linked in some way to a specific word that represents the unique solution of the game. Words are unrelated to each other, but each of them has a hidden association with the solution. Once the clues are given, the player has one minute to find the solution. For example, given the five clues: _sin_, _Newton_, _doctor_, _New York_, _bad_, the solution is **apple**, because: the apple is the symbol of original sin in Christian theology; Newton discovered the gravity by means of an apple; _“an apple a day keeps the doctor away”_ is a famous proverb; New York city is also called _“the big apple”_; and _“one bad apple can spoil the whole bunch”_ is a popular phrase which figuratively means that the person doing wrong can have a negative influence on those around him. “La Ghigliottina” is a challenging language game which demands knowledge covering a broad range of topics. Artificial players for that game can take advantage from the availability of open repositories on the web, such as Wikipedia, that provide the system with the cultural and linguistic background needed to understand clues [5]. 
Participants must build an artificial player able to solve “La Ghigliottina”.
